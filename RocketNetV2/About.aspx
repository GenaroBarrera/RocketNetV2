    <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Pokemon! </p>
<p>People in this world enjoy trading, battling, and collecting Pokemon. However, we are Team Rocket, and we are above those petty things. Instead, we steal Pokemon, and are willing to sell to prospective buyers for low prices!
      Capturing Pokemon can be difficult at times.
      <p>We understand this! For this reason, anyone can buy any Pokemon from us assuming they have enough money, 
          rather than spend hours of back-breaking work tracking down that elusive Pokemon they’ve always wanted.

<p>To protect the world from devastation! 
<p>To unite all peoples within our nation! 
<p>To denounce the evils of truth and love! 
<p>To extend our reach to the stars above!
<p>To sell Pokemon at low low prices!</p>
